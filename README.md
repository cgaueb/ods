# Opening Design using Bayesian Optimization

## Overview
Opening Design using Bayesian Optimization

This repository contains the source code that is part of the supplemental material for the *[Paper: Opening Design using Bayesian Optimization](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2096579623000256?via%3Dihub)* that was presented in CGI 2023. The contents are:

- Source code
- Unreal Engine project file
- 3rd Party pre-compiled libraries
- Test scenes
